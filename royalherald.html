									<h4>The conference began on an "unprecedented" scale. Delegates around the world gathered at the Emergency Special Session to debate the Suez Crisis. In the first place, while most countries agreed to the ceasefire, Israel insisted on deploying armed forces for the purpose of self-defense. </h4>

									<h4>After clarifying the position of every country, the conference swiftly discussed the Nationalization of the Suez Canal. Egypt, with its geographical location, stated that they insisted on nationalization with their country’s revenue in consideration. France and the UK, as the main builders and organizers of the Canal, also wanted to benefit from the tax charged to the passing vessels.</h4> <br /><br />

									<h4><i>"If Egypt DO GOOD in controlling the Canal, they can keep control of it, and vice versa."</i>, said the delegate of the UK.</h4>

									<h4>According to their subsequent answer in the press conference, only under the circumstances that Egypt moderately collects tolls will they agree on Egypt's jurisdiction.</h4>

									<h4>On the other hand, France strongly asserted the intervention of the Canal operation. With its country’s interests prioritized, France was desperate to take funds from the Canal. As the original founder of the Canal, France stated that the mandatory nationalization of Canal operation in Egypt was unreasonable.</h4>

									<h4><i>“We may consider temporarily letting France control the Canal. And after they have earned enough money, we can take back the Canal then,”</i> said the delegate of Egypt.</h4>

									<h4>After The UK and France decided to cease fire, Egypt intentionally ignored the letter of declaration, saying "I didn't see the letter." In spite of the fact that the letter had announced the truce line to be set ten miles east of the Canal, the delegate of Egypt did not stand up for their own territory. Instead, the delegate remained silent and inactive.</h4>

									<h4>On 2 November 1956, the president of the French Council, Guy Mollet, was fed up with the slow negotiation process, and announced the statement at 4:00 p.m., “The slowness of its procedure would make this decision unwise when immediate repercussions are to be feared.” The UK, also concerning their commercial benefits influenced by the Suez Canal, jointly sent troops to Egypt. With state-of-the-art weapons and fierce airstrikes, both countries want to compulsorily seize back control of the Suez Canal.</h4>

									<h4>Nevertheless, the delegate of Egypt conveyed her dissatisfaction with the inefficiency of the conference regardless of her absence.</h4>									

									<h4>France stated at the conference this afternoon, “France is just trying to get the Canal under control, we don’t mean harming any civilians,” which is totally ridiculous. How can a war proceed without injuring anyone? When asked about the question of peace and human acts, the delegate simply said “We are just to ensure the safety and peace of the Canal region.” It seems that France considered dropping bombs from the air a harmless measure.</h4>

									<h4>Through fierce debates, there seems to be no consensus reached on the conference. One bloc, led by the USA and Saudi Arabia, requested Franco-British coalition forces to withdraw from Egypt as soon as possible. On the other hand, the other bloc, led by the UK, France, and Israel, insisted that this was an efficient way to retrieve peace in the Middle East. Eventually, the USA and Saudi Arabia obtained support from the USSR, Turkey, and so on. Therefore, the DD asking for withdrawal finally passed by the special session. Nevertheless, the session didn’t have the right of constraint, so the military action wouldn’t stop despite the DD. Let’s see what will happen at the conference tomorrow. Would France and the UK abide by the Draft Directive or keep posing a threat to the lives of Egyptians? Please stay in tune!</h4>
