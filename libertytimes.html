									<h1>Clarification? Disaster? <br /> Barely ZERO progress in TWO sessions</h1>
								</header>

								<p><b><i>Countries’ discussion on facial recognition in UNESCO mainly focuses on the problem of inaccuracy. However, it was totally a disaster.</i></b></p>

								<header class="main">
									<h2>The unclear position of the United States led to most countries being nomadic throughout the conference.</h2>

								<h4>As we all know, the United States(US) is the leader of democratic countries. However, from the very first session, they have an extreme implicit stance, not even being able to answer the question from the delegates of Panama and France. We believe that if the US doesn't declare its position as soon as possible, the whole conference won’t be able to move on smoothly. What’s worse, the “small countries” won’t know what to follow. We believe that only when the US sticks to its principles can the meeting move on to the next worth discussing issue.</h4>

									<h2>Panama’s position is still vague and needs to be clarified.</h2>

								<h4>At the beginning of the conference, Panama strongly believed that they were going to collaborate with the European Union and hence stood on the same side as the EU, which is strongly against the policy of China. However, we found out that Panama is actually using China’s monitoring devices in their own territories. Isn’t it quite weird? At the end of session 2, it seems that Panama has realized that it should be in the same position as China and has been trying to get on the right path. We hope that they’ll be able to stand in a right and clear position.</h4>

									<h2>Consultation of the whole to discuss the working paper failed tens of times.</h2>
								</header>

								<h4>It seems that the delegate in UNESCO isn’t willing to have an open debate on the content of the working paper. We found that they spend an entire session distributing the bloc and clarifying the position. However, in session 2, there came back to unmod to clarify Countries’ position AGAIN.</h4>

								<h4>Countries just keep restating their state but barely talk about exact solutions. We believe that the purpose of the conference is to reach a consensus and enhance a better and safer user experience of this advanced technology.</h4>

								<h4>If they’re not going to discuss further information and talk more, we’re afraid that the public might eventually be disappointed about the result. In other words, countries might not reach a consensus at the end of the conference.</h4>
