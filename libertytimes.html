								<h4>Countries’ discussion on facial recognition in UNESCO mainly focusesfocus on the aspects of personal privacy and the drawbacks of facial recognition.</h4>

								<h4>Aiming to the arguments of the application in colored peoplecoloured-people, the delegate of the United States declared that the main users of facial recognition are all white people who are also more affordable. Moreover, the experimental targets of this technology are also concentrated in whiteswhite; therefore, the problem of discrimination isn’t actually a matter that the public needsneed to be concernedconcern about right away. After all, facial recognition is still progressing gradually. The accusation of discrimination is totally misleading the public.</h4>

								<h4>“Plastic surgery has always been an issue that ought to be valued as facial recognition has been widely applied,” the delegate of China claimed. The popularity of aesthetic medicine increases the chances of changing faces. In other words, biometric traits aren’t as distinctive as we expect them to be. However, as we can see in the academic session, a number of countries still believe that facial recognition brings high levels of convenience and scores of benefits, sticking FIRMLY to their position.</h4>

								<h4>The delegate of Argentina also mentioned that the privacy issue should also be discussed since human rights are more and more important. She believed that establishing a system to prevent this potential risk. However, most of the developed countries believed that detailed information ought to be considered; otherwise, eventually, only developed countries will be the ones who are disbursing. Yet, if those developed countriescountries’ still keep an indifferent attitude toward the possible solution, the problem will never be solved.</h4>

								<h4>It seems that this ongoing issue still needs to be more comprehensive and detailed so that the committee can come up with valid solutions to cope with the problems that facial recognition results in. It’s high time that ALL countries reached a consensus and made this technological revolution a safe and valid means.</h4>
